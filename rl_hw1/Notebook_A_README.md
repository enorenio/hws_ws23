## README
We strongly recommend you install `gymnasium>=0.28.1` and `python>=3.10.*`. You can set up a python environment using e.g. [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/) in the terminal
```
conda create -n rl23 python=3.10 gymnasium=0.28.1 notebook -c conda-forge
conda activate rl23
```
The `notebook` package is required for opening and working with this jupyter notebook.
In a terminal with the Python environment active, run
```
jupyter notebook sysadmin.ipynb
```
If you need help setting up a development environment, please visit the office hour or ask for help in the forum.
